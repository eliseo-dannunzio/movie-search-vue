## Caveats

* This is a Desktop only solution.
* I did not have time to make this responsive, so no mobile solution supported yet. I may update this in a later version.
* I would have loved to have created a scrolling side bar, but I would have pushed the limits with time. I may update this in a later version.
* I did not venture into using flex within the layout due to my lack of expertise in "flex". I may update this in a later version once I have investigated it thoroughly.
* I also would have loved to have created a pagination component, but it's late at night and I'm just glad to have completed the challenge. I may update this in a later version.
* Searches are done by clicking the sesarch icon. The Enter key has been disabled to prevent accidental presses. I may update this in a later version.
